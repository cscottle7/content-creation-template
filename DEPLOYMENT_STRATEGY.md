## üîß Deployment Steps

### Phase 1: Pre-Production Validation (15 minutes)

```bash
# 1. Final build verification
npm run build
npm run lint
npm run type-check

# 2. Run comprehensive test suite
node tests/cross-browser-testing.js
node tests/accessibility-audit.js
node tests/performance-testing.js
node tests/monitoring-validation.js

# 3. Verify all critical paths
npm run test:e2e  # End-to-end testing
npm run test:critical-path  # Critical user journeys
```

### Phase 2: Production Environment Setup (10 minutes)

```bash
# 1. Vercel project configuration
vercel --prod --build-env NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID=$GA_ID
vercel --prod --build-env NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://thebiggerboss.com.au
vercel --prod --build-env SMTP_HOST=$SMTP_HOST
vercel --prod --build-env SMTP_USER=$SMTP_USER
vercel --prod --build-env SMTP_PASS=$SMTP_PASS

# 2. Domain configuration
vercel domains add thebiggerboss.com.au
vercel alias set [deployment-url] thebiggerboss.com.au

# 3. SSL certificate verification
vercel certs ls
```

### Phase 3: Zero-Downtime Deployment (5 minutes)

```bash
# 1. Deploy to Vercel with alias strategy
vercel deploy --prod --force

# 2. Verify deployment health
curl -f https://thebiggerboss.com.au/api/monitoring/health

# 3. Switch traffic to new deployment
vercel alias set [new-deployment-url] thebiggerboss.com.au
```

### Phase 4: Post-Deployment Validation (10 minutes)

```bash
# 1. Health check validation
curl -f https://thebiggerboss.com.au/api/monitoring/health
curl -f https://thebiggerboss.com.au/api/monitoring/metrics

# 2. Critical path testing
node tests/production-validation.js

# 3. Analytics verification
# Visit https://thebiggerboss.com.au and verify tracking in GA4
```

---

## üîÑ Rollback Plan

### Automatic Rollback Triggers
- Health check endpoint returns 503 status
- Error rate exceeds 5% within 5 minutes
- Page load time exceeds 5 seconds
- Critical feature failure (forms, analytics)

### Manual Rollback Procedure

#### Option 1: Vercel Alias Rollback (< 1 minute)
```bash
# 1. Identify previous working deployment
vercel deployments list

# 2. Switch alias to previous deployment
vercel alias set [previous-deployment-url] thebiggerboss.com.au

# 3. Verify rollback success
curl -f https://thebiggerboss.com.au/api/monitoring/health
```

#### Option 2: Git Revert and Redeploy (5-10 minutes)
```bash
# 1. Revert to last known good commit
git log --oneline -n 10
git revert [problematic-commit-hash]

# 2. Push revert and redeploy
git push origin master
vercel deploy --prod

# 3. Update alias
vercel alias set [reverted-deployment-url] thebiggerboss.com.au
```

#### Option 3: Emergency Maintenance Mode (< 30 seconds)
```bash
# Deploy minimal maintenance page
vercel deploy --prod ./maintenance-mode
vercel alias set [maintenance-deployment] thebiggerboss.com.au
```
