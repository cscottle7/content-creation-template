### **User Walk-Through: From Brief to Blueprint**

This guide will walk you through the process of using 'The Bigger Boss' to generate a complete, strategically-aligned content package.

#### **Step 1: Starting a New Project**

Your interaction begins by providing the project details in the user interface. The agent is designed for simplicity, so you do not need to select a mode; it is determined automatically by the inputs you provide.

**1\. Provide Core Inputs (Required for all projects):**

* **Brand Name:** The name of the client's brand.  
* **Brand Website URL:** The primary URL for the brand's website.  
* **Target Keywords:** A list of primary keywords for the content.  
* **Target Location:** The geographic target for the campaign.  
* **Primary Campaign Goal:** The main objective of the content (e.g., "increase organic search visibility").

**2\. Select Your Workflow (via Optional Inputs):**

* **To Create Fresh Content (Default):** Simply provide only the Core Inputs. The agent will execute its full research and generation workflow from scratch.  
* **To Create Style-Influenced Content:** Provide the Core Inputs plus an **Example Style URL** . The agent will create new content that emulates the voice, tone, and structure of the provided example.  
* **To Rewrite or Adapt Content:** Provide the Core Inputs plus the **Content to Rewrite** (as text, a file, or a URL) . The agent will enhance or repurpose this existing text.  
* **(Optional) To Bypass AI Strategy Inference:** If you have the client's own strategy document, you can provide an **Existing Strategy Document** (USP/SWOT analysis) . This will instruct the agent to use the provided document as the strategic foundation, bypassing its own inference step.

#### **Step 2: The Agent Gets to Work (Automated Workflow)**

Once you submit the inputs, the Manager Agent works autonomously in the background. It deploys a team of specialised agents to conduct in-depth research and analysis.

Throughout this automated process, you will receive status updates at key milestones to maintain transparency on the agent's progress.

#### **Step 3: Reviewing Your Content Package**

All final deliverables are consolidated and presented in the "Review Portal" for your assessment. This comprehensive package includes:

* **Inferred Strategic Analysis:** If you did not provide a strategy document, the agent presents its inferred USP and SWOT analysis. This report includes confidence scores and the specific source text snippets from the client's website that justify its conclusions, making validation simple and transparent.  
* **Content Strategy & Blueprint:** This key deliverable synthesises all the research into a coherent plan. It includes a detailed audience style guide and structured briefs for the content to be drafted.  
* **High-Quality First Draft:** The agent generates a draft that automatically integrates proven content structures and techniques from an internal knowledge base ("Gem Ideas") to improve quality and effectiveness .  
* **Automated Quality & Optimization Report:** The draft is refined through automated checks, including a "Devil's Advocate" critique to identify weaknesses and variations of content for A/B testing or social media use.

#### **Step 4: Providing Feedback for Improvement**

Your feedback is crucial for improving both the immediate draft and the agent's long-term performance, and the system uses a two-tiered approach .

* **Tier 1: Immediate Feedback:** In the Review Portal, use the simple star-rating system (1-5 stars) to provide immediate feedback on the quality of each generated draft . This is essential for tracking first-draft quality and overall system performance.  
* **Tier 2: Strategic Refinement (Optional):** To contribute to the agent's long-term learning, you have the option to upload curated performance data (e.g., analytics exports) from the content after it has been published. The agent will analyse this data to propose strategic refinements for future projects, helping the system learn and adapt over time.
