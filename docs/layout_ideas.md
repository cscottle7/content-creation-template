### **High-Level Landing Page Layout for 'The Bigger Boss'**

#### **1\. Hero Section (Above the Fold)**

The goal here is to grab attention and communicate the core value in under 5 seconds.

* **Headline:** Powerful, benefit-driven, and audience-focused.  
  * e.g., **"Stop Competing. Start Dominating. The AI Content Strategist for Ambitious Aussie Businesses."**  
* **Sub-headline:** Briefly explains what the product is and for whom.  
  * e.g., "Leverage a team of specialised AI agents to automate your research, craft superior content strategies, and gain an unbeatable competitive edge."  
* **Primary Call-to-Action (CTA):** A prominent, high-contrast button.  
  * e.g., **"Start Your Limited Free Trial"**  
* **Supporting Trust Signal:** A small line of text below the CTA.  
  * e.g., "No credit card required. Get your first full content blueprint on us."  
* **Visual (MVP):** A clean, abstract animated graphic of a neural network or data flowing, reinforcing the "cutting-edge" vibe.  
* **Visual (Future Version):** This is where the interactive **"Live Strategy Teaser"** module would be placed.

* **Primary CTA:** This should use the `Button` component with the `primary` and `contained` variants to ensure it has the highest visual emphasis. The design must meet WCAG contrast guidelines to be prominent and accessible.  
* **Visual:** The abstract animated graphic is a strong choice. It reinforces the "cutting-edge" principle without distracting from the core message.

#### **2\. Problem & Agitation Section**

This section connects with the visitor's pain points.

* **Headline:** Directly addresses the core problem.  
  * e.g., **"Is Your Content Working Hard Enough?"**  
* **Pain Points (3-Column Layout):** Briefly describe the struggles of your target audiences.  
  * **Column 1 (For SMBs):** "Falling behind bigger competitors who have entire marketing teams."  
  * **Column 2 (For Agencies):** "Struggling to scale the delivery of high-quality, strategic work for every client."  
  * **Column 3 (For Both):** "Wasting hours on research and drafting for content that fails to deliver results."

**Problem & Agitation Section**

* **3-Column Layout:** To achieve this, I recommend using `Card` components. Each column's content can be placed within a  
   `Card` using the `flat` or `outlined` variant for a clean, visually grouped appearance that doesn't compete with the main CTAs.

#### **3\. Solution & Value Proposition Section**

Introduce 'The Bigger Boss' as the specific solution.

* **Headline:** Differentiates the product from simple tools.  
  * e.g., **"This Isn't Another AI Writer. It's Your New Strategy Director."**  
* **Core Promise:** A concise paragraph explaining that the agent automates the *entire strategic workflow*—from deep analysis to a high-quality first draft—so users can focus on the final, human touch.

* This section relies heavily on strong typography to convey its message. We will apply the principles of visual hierarchy, using a larger, bolder font for the headline to differentiate it from the supporting paragraph text.

#### **4\. "How It Works" Section**

A simple, visual explanation of the process.

* **Step 1: Provide Your Brief.** (Icon: Checklist) \- Show a simple UI of the inputs (Brand URL, Goal). Emphasise simplicity.  
* **Step 2: The Agents Get to Work.** (Icon: Gears/Brain) \- Briefly mention the multi-agent research (Brand, Audience, Competitor analysis).  
* **Step 3: Receive Your Strategic Blueprint.** (Icon: Document/Trophy) \- Show a mockup of the final deliverable in the "Review Portal."  
* **Icons:** Each step should feature a distinct `Icon` from our consistent library to aid quick recognition.  
* **UI Mockups:** The visuals depicting the UI (e.g., inputs for "Provide Your Brief") should use our standard `Text Input` and `Button` components to ensure the entire page feels like a single, cohesive product.

#### **5\. Features as Benefits Section**

This is where you detail the "wow" factor, framing features in terms of what the customer gains.

* **Headline:** **"An Unfair Advantage for Every Goal"**  
* **Dual-Path Tabs (MVP):** Use simple tabs for **"For Your Business"** and **"For Your Agency"** to tailor the benefits.  
  * **Under "For Your Business":**  
    1. **Uncover Your Competitive Edge:** Explain how the competitor analysis gives them the upper hand.  
    2. **Speak Directly to Your Customers:** Detail how the audience intent research leads to more resonant content.  
    3. **Publish with Total Confidence:** Describe how the blueprint and quality drafts remove the guesswork.  
  * **Under "For Your Agency":**  
    1. **Deliver Premium Strategy at Scale:** Focus on the efficiency gains and ability to serve more clients.  
    2. **Onboard Clients in Record Time:** Highlight the speed of generating a full strategy.  
    3. **Become an Indispensable Partner:** Emphasise the data-backed insights that impress clients.  
* **Visuals (Future Version):** This is the ideal spot for the **Interactive WebGL Workflow Animation.**

* **Dual-Path Tabs:** This is a perfect use case for the `Tabs` component. We will use a standard horizontal  
   `Tabs` variant. The tab labels must be clear and concise (1-2 words) to efficiently segment the content for the two primary audiences. The content within each tab panel can be structured using lists or  
   `Card` elements for readability.

#### **6\. The Offer & Final CTA Section**

A clear, friction-free final pitch.

* **Headline:** **"Your Strategic Blueprint is Ready."**  
* **The Offer:** A summary of the free trial.  
  * e.g., "Get 1 Full Content Strategy & First Draft, Absolutely Free."  
* **Final CTA Button:** A large, impossible-to-miss button.  
  * e.g., **"Claim Your Free Trial Now"**

* **Final CTA Button:** Similar to the hero, this calls for a `Button` component. We can use the  
   `primary` and `contained` variants again, but we might consider using a larger `size` prop to make it feel even more significant and "impossible-to-miss".

#### **7\. FAQ Section**

Address final objections.

* **Structure:** An accordion-style list to keep the page clean.  
* **Content:** Include the key questions we identified:  
  * "How is this different from other AI writers?"  
  * "Do I need to be an SEO expert to use this?"  
  * "How does this improve my ROI?"  
  * "What happens after my free trial ends?"

* **Accordion Structure:** The design system specifies that complex components should be built from foundational ones. For the requested accordion, we can create this interaction by using a series of  
   `Card` components. The title area of each card will serve as the click-trigger to reveal the answer contained within the body of the card, creating a clean and user-friendly FAQ section.

#### **8\. Footer**

Standard legal and navigation links (Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, Contact).

* This section should be built using semantic HTML (  
  `<footer>`, `<nav>`) and contain a simple list of links, adhering to the accessibility and navigation principles outlined in the design system.
