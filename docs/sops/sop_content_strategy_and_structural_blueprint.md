## 1.0 Purpose

The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to establish a definitive methodology for content strategy and structure. It formalises the process of analysing search intent and provides a rules-based blueprint for structuring content to simultaneously satisfy three key audiences: human readers, search engine crawlers, and AI content creation agents.

## 2.0 Scope

This SOP applies to all content strategists, SEO analysts, content creators, and AI agents (specifically `@plan_creator`) at Discover Web Solutions. It governs the planning and structuring phase of all new content, ensuring every piece is built on a sound strategic foundation and follows a consistent, optimised format.

## 3.0 Definitions

* **Search Intent:** The underlying purpose or "why" behind a user's search query. This SOP classifies intent into four distinct categories.
* **SERP (Search Engine Results Page):** The page displayed by a search engine in response to a query. It is considered the ultimate arbiter of intent.
* **Semantic HTML:** The use of HTML tags that convey the meaning and structure of the content they enclose, rather than just its appearance. This is critical for search engine comprehension.
* **Cognitive Load:** The amount of mental effort required to process information. A primary goal of content structure is to minimise this for human readers.

## 4.0 Procedures

This SOP is divided into two core procedures: establishing the strategic foundation through intent analysis and defining the structural blueprint for content creation.

### 4.1 Procedure: Strategic Foundation - Search Intent Analysis

The entire content architecture must be organised around search intent. This procedure outlines the models and methodologies for its correct identification.

#### **4.1.1 The Four Core Search Intents**

A comprehensive framework must be used to classify user intent. This model includes four distinct categories:

* **Informational ("Know"):** The user seeks to acquire information on a topic, often phrasing the query as a question (e.g., "what is project management?").
* **Navigational ("Go"):** The user intends to reach a specific website or page and typically uses a brand or product name in the query (e.g., "Facebook login").
* **Transactional ("Do"):** The user intends to perform a web-mediated activity, most commonly a purchase, and uses action-oriented words (e.g., "buy body cream").
* **Commercial Investigation:** This critical fourth category captures the pre-purchase research phase. The user is comparing options and evaluating alternatives (e.g., "best gaming computers," "project management software reviews").

#### **4.1.2 The Strategic Intent-to-Page-Type Matrix**

To eliminate guesswork, this matrix provides a rules-based system for aligning search intent with the correct page type, user goal, content elements, call-to-action (CTA), and primary E-E-A-T signal.

| Page Type | Informational Intent | Commercial Investigation Intent | Transactional Intent | Navigational Intent |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Blog Post / Article** | **Primary User Goal:** To find a comprehensive answer, learn a process, or understand a concept. | **Primary User Goal:** To read an in-depth review, comparison, or "best of" list to evaluate options. | **Primary User Goal:** N/A (Generally a poor fit; user wants to buy, not read a long article). | **Primary User Goal:** To find a specific article or news update from a known brand/publication. |
| | **Critical Content Elements:** Step-by-step instructions, definitions, expert quotes, diagrams, infographics, FAQs, how-to videos. | **Critical Content Elements:** Detailed pros and cons, feature comparison tables, star ratings, authentic user testimonials, original photos/videos of the product in use, clear recommendations for different use cases. | **Critical Content Elements:** N/A. | **Critical Content Elements:** Clear headline, author name, publication date, prominent branding. |
| | **Optimal Primary CTA:** "Download the Full Guide," "Subscribe for More Tips," "Watch the Tutorial Video". | **Optimal Primary CTA:** "See Our Top Pick," "Compare Prices," "Read Full Review," "View Product". | **Optimal Primary CTA:** N/A. | **Optimal Primary CTA:** "Read More from This Author," "Explore Related Topics". |
| | **E-E-A-T Signal:** **Expertise**. The content must demonstrate a deep level of knowledge and skill on the topic through accuracy, depth, and clarity. | **E-E-A-T Signal:** **Experience**. The content must prove first-hand, real-world use of the product/service being reviewed. Authenticity is key. | **E-E-A-T Signal:** N/A. | **E-E-A-T Signal:** **Authoritativeness**. The brand must be a recognized authority on the topic being discussed. |
| **Service Page** | **Primary User Goal:** To understand what a service is and how it generally works. | **Primary User Goal:** To evaluate a specific company's service, its features, benefits, and how it compares to alternatives. | **Primary User Goal:** To purchase or sign up for a specific service. | **Primary User Goal:** To find the service page of a specific, known company. |
| | **Critical Content Elements:** Definition of the service, explanation of the process, common problems it solves. | **Critical Content Elements:** Detailed service features, case studies, client testimonials, pricing tiers, comparison to other solutions, FAQs about the service. | **Critical Content Elements:** Clear value proposition, pricing, a prominent and simple sign-up/contact form, trust seals, guarantees. | **Critical Content Elements:** Clear service name, company branding, direct contact information. |
| | **Optimal Primary CTA:** "Learn More About Our Process," "Read a Case Study". | **Optimal Primary CTA:** "Request a Demo," "See Pricing," "Get a Custom Quote," "Talk to an Expert". | **Optimal Primary CTA:** "Get Started Now," "Sign Up," "Schedule a Consultation". | **Optimal Primary CTA:** "Contact Us," "Request a Quote". |
| | **E-E-A-T Signal:** **Expertise**. Clearly explaining a complex service demonstrates a high level of domain knowledge. | **E-E-A-T Signal:** **Trustworthiness**. Case studies and testimonials are critical for building trust in the service's promised outcomes. | **E-E-A-T Signal:** **Trustworthiness**. The user is about to transact; the page must feel secure, professional, and reliable. | **E-E-A-T Signal:** **Authoritativeness**. The page should confirm this is the official, authoritative source for this service. |

#### **4.1.3 Methodology for Real-Time Intent Analysis via SERP Deconstruction**

The live SERP is the definitive source of truth for user intent. A repeatable analysis must be performed using the following checklist:

* **Analyze Dominant Content Types:** Observe the type of pages ranking in the top positions. Blog posts indicate informational intent. Product pages indicate transactional intent. A mix of listicles and category pages indicates commercial investigation.
* **Analyze Content Formats:** Examine the format of the content itself (e.g., "how-to" guides, listicles, comparison tables, reviews). Matching the dominant format is critical.
* **Analyze SERP Features:** Identify features that signal intent:
    * **Featured Snippets:** Definitive signal of informational intent.
    * **"People Also Ask" (PAA) Boxes:** A goldmine for informational or commercial subtopics.
    * **Shopping Ads / Product Carousels:** Unambiguous signal of high commercial or transactional intent.
    * **Local Map Pack:** Indicates transactional or commercial intent with a specific geographic focus.
* **Analyze Content Angle:** Assess the perspective of top-ranking pages (e.g., beginner vs. expert, budget vs. premium) to identify the prevailing approach or a gap to differentiate.

### 4.2 Procedure: The Structural Blueprint - Multi-Audience Optimisation

Content must be structured to meet the needs of human readers, search engines, and AI agents simultaneously.

#### **4.2.1 Optimising for Human Readability**

The goal is to minimise cognitive load and make content highly scannable.

* **Headings & Subheadings:** Use a clear visual hierarchy (H1, H2, H3) to act as signposts and break content into logical sections.
* **Short Paragraphs:** Keep paragraphs to three to five sentences (under 150 words). Start a new paragraph for each new idea.
* **Short Sentences:** Target an average sentence length of 12 to 20 words to reduce complexity.
* **Bulleted and Numbered Lists:** Use lists to present information in a highly scannable format that naturally draws the eye. Use `<ol>` for sequential steps and `<ul>` for non-sequential items.
* **Strategic Use of Bolding:** Use bolding sparingly to make key phrases stand out and summarise a paragraph's core point for scanning readers.
* **Generous White Space:** Use margins, line spacing, and breaks between elements as an active design tool to reduce clutter and make content feel approachable.

#### **4.2.2 Optimising for Search Engine Comprehension**

Use semantic HTML to provide explicit, unambiguous signals about the content's structure and meaning to search engine crawlers.

* **Semantic HTML for SEO:**
    * **Structural Elements:** Use tags like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, and `<footer>` to define the page architecture so crawlers can prioritise the main content.
    * **Heading Tags (<h1>-<h6>):** Use one, and only one, `<h1>` per page as the main title. Subheadings must follow a logical, sequential hierarchy (H2 -> H3 -> H4) without skipping levels.
    * **List and Table Tags:** Use proper `<ol>`, `<ul>`, and `<table>` tags to structure data. This is critical for winning list- and table-style Featured Snippets.
* **Winning Featured Snippets:**
    * **Provide Direct Answers:** Place a clear, concise answer (40-60 words) in a `<p>` tag immediately following the heading that asks the target question.
    * **Match the Snippet Format:** Analyse the SERP first. If a snippet exists, match its format (paragraph, list, table) precisely.
    * **Use Question-Based Headings:** Structure `<h2>` and `<h3>` headings as the exact questions found in "People Also Ask" boxes to create a direct match with user queries.

#### **4.2.3 Optimising for AI Interpretation (Structural Briefing Template)**

To ensure an AI agent produces a well-structured first draft, all structural requirements must be translated into explicit commands within the content brief. The following template must be used.

```markdown
### Prescribed Content Structure

**Objective:** The following structure is designed to optimize for human readability (scannability) and search engine comprehension (semantic hierarchy). Adhere to it precisely. Use proper Markdown for all headings.

**H1: [Primary Keyword and Article Title]**

**Introduction:** (Approx. 100-150 words)
* Begin with an engaging hook that introduces the topic and states the primary pain point the reader is facing.
* In a single, concise paragraph, provide a direct answer to the core question of the topic. This paragraph is intended to target a paragraph-style featured snippet.

**H2: [First Key Sub-Topic, phrased as a question if possible]**

* Paragraph 1: (3-4 sentences) Explain the core idea of this section.
* Paragraph 2: (3-4 sentences) Elaborate on the idea with a concrete example or supporting data.
* **Bulleted List:** Use a `<ul>` for the following features/points (non-sequential).
    * Point 1
    * Point 2
    * Point 3

**H2: [Second Key Sub-Topic, often a "How-To" or process]**

* Provide a brief introductory sentence for the steps that follow.
* **Numbered List:** Use an `<ol>` for the following step-by-step instructions (sequential).
    1.  Step 1:
    2.  Step 2:
    3.  Step 3:

**H2: [Third Key Sub-Topic, often a comparison or data-focused]**

* **Table:** Create an HTML or markdown table with the following columns: 'Feature', 'Option A', 'Option B'.
* Populate the table with at least 4 rows of comparative data, ensuring the information is clear and easy to contrast.

**H2: Conclusion**

* Write a summary paragraph that recaps the most important takeaways from the article.
* Conclude with the primary Call-to-Action: [Specify CTA here].
