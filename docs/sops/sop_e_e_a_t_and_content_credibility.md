## 1.0 Purpose

The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to establish a formal framework for implementing and maintaining signals of credibility across all web content. It is based on Google's E-E-A-T framework—Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness—which is used to evaluate the quality and reliability of content. Adherence to this SOP is non-negotiable for "Your Money or Your Life" (YMYL) topics, which are those that can significantly impact a person's health, finances, or safety.

## 2.0 Scope

This SOP applies to all content creators, editors, content strategists, and AI agents (including `@content_reviewer`) involved in the creation, auditing, and maintenance of content for Discover Web Solutions and its clients. It covers the implementation of all E-E-A-T signals and the process for ensuring content remains fresh, accurate, and trustworthy over time.

## 3.0 Definitions

* **E-E-A-T:** An acronym for Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness. It is a framework used by Google to assess the credibility of content and its creator.
* **Content Freshness:** The process of systematically identifying, updating, and republishing existing content to ensure it remains accurate, relevant, and trustworthy.
* **YMYL (Your Money or Your Life):** A category of topics that could significantly impact a person's health, happiness, financial stability, or safety. Content in this category is held to the highest standard of E-E-A-T.

### 4.2 Procedure: Content Freshness Management

Trustworthiness must be maintained over time. Outdated or inaccurate content erodes user trust and signals to search engines that a page is no longer the best resource. A systematic process for updating content is essential for maintaining E-E-A-T.

#### **Step 1: Triggers for a Content Update**
A content update should be initiated when specific data-driven triggers are observed, prioritized by potential impact.

* **Performance Decay Triggers:**
    * **Significant Traffic Drop:** A sustained drop in organic traffic (>20% month-over-month) to a high-value page.
    * **Keyword Ranking Decline:** A drop in rankings for primary keywords (e.g., falling off page 1 or dropping 5+ positions).
    * **Reduced Engagement Metrics:** A notable increase in bounce rate or decrease in time on page.
    * **Conversion Rate Decline:** A drop in leads or sales from a commercial or transactional page.
* **Content-Based Triggers:**
    * **Outdated Information:** The content contains statistics, dates, or references that are no longer current.
    * **Factual Inaccuracy:** A process, law, or fact mentioned in the content has changed.
    * **Broken Links:** The page contains broken internal or external links.
    * **SERP Evolution:** A manual review of the SERP shows the dominant intent or content format for the keyword has changed.

#### **Step 2: The Content Update and Republishing Process**
Once a page is flagged, it must undergo a structured refresh process.

1.  **Re-assess Search Intent:** Perform a fresh SERP analysis for the primary keyword to determine if the dominant intent or required format has changed.
2.  **Conduct a Content Gap Analysis:** Compare the existing content against the current top 3-5 ranking pages to identify new subtopics or user questions that are now required for comprehensiveness.
3.  **Perform the Content Rewrite/Expansion:**
    * Update all outdated statistics, dates, and facts.
    * Rewrite sections that are unclear or inaccurate.
    * Add new sections to cover identified content gaps.
    * Incorporate new visuals, examples, or expert quotes.
    * Optimize the content based on the latest structural and stylistic best practices.
4.  **Review and Quality Assurance:** The updated content must pass the standard editorial review process for accuracy, clarity, and tone.
5.  **Republish the Content:**
    * The content MUST be updated on the **existing URL**. Creating a new URL will sacrifice the page's authority and backlinks and is forbidden.
    * The "Last Updated" date must be changed to the current date.

#### **Step 3: Signaling "Freshness" to Users and Search Engines**
After republishing, it is vital to explicitly signal that the content has been updated.

* **Signaling to Users:**
    * **Display a "Last Updated On..." Date:** Prominently display the new update date near the top of the article. This immediately communicates to users that the information is current.
    * **Add an "Editor's Note" (for major updates):** Consider adding a note at the top explaining the scope of the update (e.g., *"Editor's Note: This article was originally published in May 2023 and has been completely updated for accuracy and comprehensiveness as of June 2025."*).
* **Signaling to Search Engines:**
    * **Update the Modified Date in the Sitemap:** Ensure the `<lastmod>` tag for the URL in the XML sitemap is updated to the new date to encourage re-crawling.
    * **Use Schema Markup:** The `dateModified` property within Article or BlogPosting schema must be updated to the new date.
    * **Request Re-indexing:** Use the "URL Inspection" tool in Google Search Console to submit the updated URL, which can expedite Google's recognition of the changes.
