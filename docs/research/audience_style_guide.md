#### **Persona-Specific Tone**

* **How to Write for Samira (The SMB Owner):**  
  * **Tone:** Empathetic, straightforward, and reassuring. Acknowledge her lack of time and expertise.  
  * **Language:** Use simple, direct language. Avoid marketing acronyms (e.g., say "search engine ranking" instead of "SERP"). Use analogies she can relate to (e.g., "Think of it as a recipe for your marketing"). Focus on tangible outcomes like "more customers," "increased sales," and "saving time."  
  * **Sentence Structure:** Keep sentences and paragraphs short and scannable. Use questions to engage her directly (e.g., "Tired of guessing what to write?").  
* **How to Write for David (The Agency Manager):**  
  * **Tone:** Professional, data-centric, and confident. Speak to him as a peer who understands the agency world.  
  * **Language:** Use professional marketing terminology (e.g., ROI, LTV, Churn, SERP, KPI). Focus on agency-specific benefits like "efficiency," "scalability," "profitability," and "client retention." Frame outputs as "client-ready" and "data-backed."  
  * **Sentence Structure:** Sentences can be more complex, but should remain direct and purposeful. Use industry-specific data points and metrics to build credibility.
