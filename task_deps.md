# The Bigger Boss Website - Development Task Dependencies (v1.0)

## Executive Summary

This development plan transforms The Bigger Boss strategic brief into an executable roadmap for building a conversion-optimized SaaS marketing website. The plan prioritizes rapid market validation through persona-specific landing pages while establishing the technical foundation for the AI content strategist platform targeting Australian SMBs and marketing agencies.

**Strategic Alignment**: Every task directly supports the core business objective of converting two distinct personas (Samira - SMB Owner, David - Agency Manager) through tailored value propositions and lead magnet systems. The phased approach ensures critical conversion pathways are operational first, followed by content authority building and technical enhancements.

**Success Metrics Integration**: The development plan incorporates tracking capabilities to measure the defined KPIs: 1,000 unique visitors (first month), 15% CTR for lead magnets, and 10% conversion rate on lead magnet assets.

## Risk Mitigation Strategy

### Technical Risks
- **Complex Animation Performance**: Implement progressive enhancement for Framer Motion and React Three Fiber components with fallbacks for low-performance devices
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Adopt mobile-first design approach with comprehensive device testing throughout development
- **Third-Party Dependencies**: Pin dependency versions and maintain fallback strategies for critical functionality

### Content Production Risks
- **Content Quality Standards**: Establish editorial guidelines ensuring 80%+ of content requires minimal edits
- **Persona Message Alignment**: Regular validation checkpoints with target persona representatives during content development
- **SEO Content Gap**: Prioritize pillar page and top cluster articles for immediate topical authority building

### Conversion Optimization Risks
- **Lead Magnet Effectiveness**: Implement A/B testing framework early to validate PDF vs webinar format preferences per persona
- **Form Abandonment**: Minimize form fields while maintaining lead qualification through progressive enhancement
- **Cross-Device Conversion**: Ensure seamless experience across desktop and mobile for all conversion paths

### Operational Risks
- **Resource Allocation**: Front-load critical conversion pages and defer nice-to-have features to post-launch iterations
- **Timeline Pressure**: Build deployment pipeline early to enable continuous integration and rapid iteration
- **Scope Creep**: Maintain strict adherence to in-scope features defined in CLAUDE.md, deferring complex animations and interactive tools
