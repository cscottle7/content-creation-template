# The Bigger Boss Website - Development Task Dependencies (v1.0)

## Executive Summary

This development plan transforms The Bigger Boss strategic brief into an executable roadmap for building a conversion-optimized SaaS marketing website. The plan prioritizes rapid market validation through persona-specific landing pages while establishing the technical foundation for the AI content strategist platform targeting Australian SMBs and marketing agencies.

**Strategic Alignment**: Every task directly supports the core business objective of converting two distinct personas (Samira - SMB Owner, David - Agency Manager) through tailored value propositions and lead magnet systems. The phased approach ensures critical conversion pathways are operational first, followed by content authority building and technical enhancements.

**Success Metrics Integration**: The development plan incorporates tracking capabilities to measure the defined KPIs: 1,000 unique visitors (first month), 15% CTR for lead magnets, and 10% conversion rate on lead magnet assets.

## Risk Mitigation Strategy

### Technical Risks
- **Complex Animation Performance**: Implement progressive enhancement for Framer Motion and React Three Fiber components with fallbacks for low-performance devices
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Adopt mobile-first design approach with comprehensive device testing throughout development
- **Third-Party Dependencies**: Pin dependency versions and maintain fallback strategies for critical functionality

### Content Production Risks
- **Content Quality Standards**: Establish editorial guidelines ensuring 80%+ of content requires minimal edits
- **Persona Message Alignment**: Regular validation checkpoints with target persona representatives during content development
- **SEO Content Gap**: Prioritize pillar page and top cluster articles for immediate topical authority building

### Conversion Optimization Risks
- **Lead Magnet Effectiveness**: Implement A/B testing framework early to validate PDF vs webinar format preferences per persona
- **Form Abandonment**: Minimize form fields while maintaining lead qualification through progressive enhancement
- **Cross-Device Conversion**: Ensure seamless experience across desktop and mobile for all conversion paths

### Operational Risks
- **Resource Allocation**: Front-load critical conversion pages and defer nice-to-have features to post-launch iterations
- **Timeline Pressure**: Build deployment pipeline early to enable continuous integration and rapid iteration
- **Scope Creep**: Maintain strict adherence to in-scope features defined in CLAUDE.md, deferring complex animations and interactive tools

## Success Validation Framework

### Development Milestones
- **Phase 1-2 Complete**: Technical foundation enables rapid page development
- **Phase 3-4 Complete**: Core conversion funnel operational for both personas
- **Phase 5-6 Complete**: Content authority foundation established with lead capture
- **Phase 7-8 Complete**: Production-ready website meeting all performance standards
- **Phase 9 Complete**: Live website actively converting visitors to leads

### Business Metrics Tracking
- **Immediate**: Deployment success, page load performance, mobile responsiveness
- **30 Days**: 1,000 unique visitors to resource hub, 15% CTR on lead magnets
- **60 Days**: 10% conversion rate on lead magnet assets, persona-specific engagement patterns
- **90 Days**: Lead-to-trial conversion tracking, content authority growth indicators

## Documentation Integration Guidelines

### For Agents Executing Tasks

1. **Pre-Task Preparation**: Review all referenced documentation before beginning task execution
2. **Compliance Validation**: Use the specified SOPs as checklists to ensure all requirements are met
3. **Quality Assurance**: Apply the standards from design and UX guidelines throughout development
4. **Knowledge Application**: Integrate research data and persona insights into all user-facing content

### Documentation Usage Patterns

- **Technical Tasks**: Prioritize TECH_STACK_REFERENCE.md and API_DOCUMENTATION.md
- **Design Tasks**: Apply conceptual_design_brief.md and accessibility_standards.md
- **Content Tasks**: Follow audience_style_guide.md and content strategy SOPs
- **Testing Tasks**: Use all relevant SOPs as validation checklists
- **Deployment Tasks**: Follow DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md procedures exactly

### Knowledge Maintenance Protocol

- Documentation references should be updated when:
  - New SOPs are added to the docs/sops/ directory
  - Research data is updated or expanded
  - Technical specifications change
- All agents must validate documentation currency before task execution
- Any conflicts between task requirements and documentation should be escalated immediately

This development plan ensures strategic alignment between technical implementation and business objectives while providing clear accountability, measurable outcomes, and comprehensive knowledge integration for each development phase.
